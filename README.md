# Random Quote Machine React App

From [FreeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine) Front End Development Libraries Projects. It is a responsive react app fetching data from external APIs to present data for quotes. 

## Improvements
- UI: I have upgraded the project with personalized UI and random background images using Axios and Unsplash API.
- Code: Converted React class components to functional components using React Hooks.
